testcase_id: TD_6LoWPAN_FORMAT_HC_16
uri: none
configuration: 6LoWPAN_CFG_01
objective: check that EUTs correctly handle compressed multicasted 6LoWPAN packets (16-bit link-local, hop limit=1 and payload=0).
pre_conditions: 
  - Header compression is enabled on both EUT1 and EUT2.
  - EUT1 and EUT2 are configured to use 16 bits addresses.
  - Hop limit is set as 1.
