Git workflow - Merge request guidelines
=======================================


If you can, please submit a merge request with the fix or improvements
including tests. If you don't know how to fix the issue but can write a test
that exposes the issue we will accept that as well. In general bug fixes that
include a regression test are merged quickly while new features without proper
tests are least likely to receive timely feedback. The workflow to make a merge
request is as follows:


.. [#] Fork the project into your personal space on gitlab
.. [#] Create a feature branch, branch away from master (if it's a fix) or develop (if it's a new feature or doc)
.. [#] Write tests, code and/or doc
.. [#] If you have multiple commits please combine them into a few logically organized commits by squashing them
.. [#] Push the commit(s) to your fork
.. [#] Submit a merge request (MR) to the master branch / develop branch (depending if it's a fix or new feature)

When having your code reviewed and when reviewing merge requests please take the
code review guidelines into account.
